Hummingbird Streaming Script

This application has many main features, the following are some of those:
<p>1. Track and discover, using your hummingbird account.
<p>2. Stream episodes from any show in Hummingbird’s database.
<p>3. listen to any show's OST anywhere on the site.
<p>4. chat, post and browse your feed.
<p>And many more.
<p>Before anyone says about my sloppy coding practices, please realize that this is not for production and is in very early development. I believe it’s better for something to work and have many other features rather that one fracture being optimized and risk being changed later.
